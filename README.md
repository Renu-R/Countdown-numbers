# Countdown-numbers
An application to play the numbers round of the countdown game show.

In the game, a randomly generated 3 digit target number is to be constructed from 6 other randomly generated numbers using the basic math operations of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. Each number can only be used once and not all numbers have to be used. The solver algorithm written uses brute force recursion trying every permutation of numbers and operators to find a mathematical expression using the input numbers that equals the target number. Creating a new Number class, where every Number holds its value and the history of steps taken to reach it, makes it easy to keep track of the steps that ultimately yeild the target number.

Using PyQt5, I designed a gui where after pressing the start button, the target and numbers are randomly generated and displayed. Then the countdown theme tune starts playing giving the players time to solve the numbers puzzle. After 30 seconds, when the music ends, the solution to the problem is displayed and the start button can be pressed again to generate a new numbers problem. Finally, I packaged the project into a .exe file so that the application can be shared by sharing the dist file and be run on any windows computer.
